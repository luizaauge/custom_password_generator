# Strong Password Generator

This project is a customized password generator that turns simple words into strong passwords with a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The downside of every Strong Password Generator is that it creates a password too difficult to remember, so I came up with this project to enhance security while maintaining an easy-to-remember password because it is based on a familiar keyword for the user.

## 🔍 Introduction

A strong password helps keeping personal information safe, such as emails, files, and other contents. It can also prevent hacking attacks. 

What makes a password strong:
- The lengh should be at least 12 characters long 
- The combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols 
- The password should be significantly different from previous ones

This repository contains a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based Custom Password Generator. 
It's an easy-to-use tool that creates secure, random passwords based on familiar words so it is easier to remember. 
The generator combines uppercase and lowercase letters from the user keyword, numbers, and symbols to create robust passwords. 

It features a user-friendly GUI and allows users to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard. Ideal for anyone who needs a quick, reliable way to generate strong passwords.
